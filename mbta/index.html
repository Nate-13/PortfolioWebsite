            <h2>Designing for accessibility.</h2>
            <p>From the beginning, my goal was to create an app that truly prioritizes accessibility. Whether someone 
                lives with visual or auditory impairments or simply doesn't speak the same language as most people in 
                Boston, everyone deserves to have an equal opportunity to navigate the city's transit system with ease. 
                To achieve this, I designed this app with many features that target accessibility. For example, the app 
                includes settings for <span>screen reader compatibility</span>, an announcements section that relays your trains' <span>spoken
                announcements to your phone screen</span>, and <span>multilingual support</span> to assist non-English speakers in understanding
                important trip and safety information.
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Existing tools fall short.</h2>
            <p>Navigating the underground with traditional tools like maps 
                and station signs can be frustrating—they're often 
                <span>outdated, inconsistent, and lack real-time updates.</span> Even modern apps like
                 Apple and Google Maps aren't fully equipped for the intricacies of
                  Boston's subway system, often <span>missing key details and accurate underground
                   tracking</span>. These tools offer a basic overview, but they fall short when it comes
                    to the specific needs of riders. My app is designed to connect directly to
                     the train you are on, providing specific and <span>relevant updates and announcements
                      directly to your palm</span>.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Color-coded and clear.</h2>
            <p>Every icon in the MBTA app leverages <span>high-contrast colors and bold geometric shapes</span>
                 to ensure clarity at a glance with visibility from dim subway tunnels to sunlit streets.
                  Icons are paired with text labels by default,
                    <span>supporting screen readers and language learners</span>. These two layers communicate
                     critical information both <span>visually and verbally</span>, ensuring accessibility for users 
                     with diverse needs. The result is a universal visual language that simplifies navigation
                      while honoring the MBTA's iconic identity.

            <h2>Holding on to history.</h2>
            <p>The Boston underground, part of the oldest subway system in America, 
                carries a deep sense of history, from its vintage fonts to the iconic
                 tile patterns that have been preserved over the decades. When designing
                  this app, the goal was to <span>honor the MBTA's rich past</span> while ensuring it
                   meets modern usability standards. The design incorporates solid, blocky
                    text reminiscent of the original station signs, with colors and shapes
                     that <span>reflect the classic color palette and design language of the MBTA</span>.
                      This blend of historical and contemporary design aims to create a 
                      familiar yet fresh user experience that feels true to the Boston transit
                       system's history. Balancing these elements was challenging, but the result 
                       is <span>an app that feels both timeless and functional</span>.

            <h2>An app that minds the gaps.</h2>
            <p>My MBTA app bridges the gaps left by outdated tools and generic navigation apps.
                 It integrates real-time train locations, service alerts, and a place for 
                 crowd-sourced updates or other necessary notifications.
                    By blending the
                     system's heritage with forward-thinking accessibility, the app doesn't just route trips—it
                      fosters confidence, ensuring every rider can navigate Boston's underground with dignity 
                      and ease.
