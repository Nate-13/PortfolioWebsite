## Phone (3a) Daybreak Edition

Daybreak is a shift; from stillness to movement, shadow to light. Phone (3a) Daybreak Edition is designed to capture exactly that. Built on a black base, iridescent accents come to life when they catch the light, bringing out deep blue, purple, and orange hues. It's designed to create those small, unexpected moments throughout your day, when the phone hits the light just right, keeping the design feeling fresh throughout the phone's lifespan. Dark bronze on the frame and internal components, paired with copper and warm-silver buttons and accents, are designed to be subtle, yet carry a slightly warmer tone. And because sunrise is something we all experience, Daybreak Edition is a nod to the things that connect us all.

## Card (52)

Card (52) is a custom-designed deck of playing cards created to accompany the Nothing Community Edition phone. Playing cards have always been about connection; gathering around a table, making memories, and having fun. I designed these cards dot by dot, leveraging the Nothing design language to create a product that is as visually interesting as they are to use. Depending on which Community Edition phone is chosen, the colors and finishes of the cards can be easily modified to match. Since the designs are built from simple, flexible elements, it's straightforward to create variations that feel cohesive with the final phone without losing the spirit of the deck.

Another reason I chose playing cards is their simplicity. They're easy to produce and cost-effective. Having designed and manufactured two decks on my own for past projects, I know how straightforward and scalable they can be. It makes them a perfect fit for a project like this: something that feels special, is easy to ship alongside the phone, and doesn't add unnecessary complexity.

## Midnight Mode

Midnight Mode transforms your lock screen at night to help you sleep better. A full red tint over pure black replaces traditional colors, creating a low-stimulation environment that's easier on the eyes. Essential information like time, notifications, and battery life remains visible but softened, ensuring that quick glances don't disrupt your rest. Night-themed wallpapers carry the same red color are enabled with Midnight Mode and dynamically change to reflect the true night sky at your location. Other details like a moon phase fingerprint reader give Midnight Mode more character.
