## Designing for accessibility.

From the beginning, my goal was to create an app that truly prioritizes accessibility. Whether someone lives with visual or auditory impairments or simply doesn't speak the same language as most people in Boston, everyone deserves to have an equal opportunity to navigate the city's transit system with ease. To achieve this, I designed this app with many features that target accessibility. For example, the app includes settings for **screen reader compatibility**, an announcements section that relays your trains' **spoken announcements to your phone screen**, and **multilingual support** to assist non-English speakers in understanding important trip and safety information.

## Existing tools fall short.

Navigating the underground with traditional tools like maps and station signs can be frustrating—they're often **outdated, inconsistent, and lack real-time updates.** Even modern apps like Apple and Google Maps aren't fully equipped for the intricacies of Boston's subway system, often **missing key details and accurate underground tracking**. These tools offer a basic overview, but they fall short when it comes to the specific needs of riders. My app is designed to connect directly to the train you are on, providing specific and **relevant updates and announcements directly to your palm**.

## Color-coded and clear.

Every icon in the MBTA app leverages **high-contrast colors and bold geometric shapes** to ensure clarity at a glance with visibility from dim subway tunnels to sunlit streets. Icons are paired with text labels by default, **supporting screen readers and language learners**. These two layers communicate critical information both **visually and verbally**, ensuring accessibility for users with diverse needs. The result is a universal visual language that simplifies navigation while honoring the MBTA's iconic identity.

## Holding on to history.

The Boston underground, part of the oldest subway system in America, carries a deep sense of history, from its vintage fonts to the iconic tile patterns that have been preserved over the decades. When designing this app, the goal was to **honor the MBTA's rich past** while ensuring it meets modern usability standards. The design incorporates solid, blocky text reminiscent of the original station signs, with colors and shapes that **reflect the classic color palette and design language of the MBTA**. This blend of historical and contemporary design aims to create a familiar yet fresh user experience that feels true to the Boston transit system's history. Balancing these elements was challenging, but the result is **an app that feels both timeless and functional**.

## An app that minds the gaps.

My MBTA app bridges the gaps left by outdated tools and generic navigation apps. It integrates real-time train locations, service alerts, and a place for crowd-sourced updates or other necessary notifications. By blending the system's heritage with forward-thinking accessibility, the app doesn't just route trips—it fosters confidence, ensuring every rider can navigate Boston's underground with dignity and ease.
