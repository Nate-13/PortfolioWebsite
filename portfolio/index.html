            <h2>Setting Out to Stand Out</h2>
            <p>Creating my portfolio website was an important project for me, as
                 it allowed me to merge my design sensibilities with newfound
                  coding skills. I wanted the site to reflect my personality and
                   approach to work, which led me to choose a bright, energetic 
                   color palette of complementary blue-purple and yellow. Bold fonts and capital 
                   letters gave the design a stronger visual identity while remaining simple.
                    My goal was to strike balance between professional, personal,
                    and exciting. I wanted visitors to leave with a clear 
                    understanding of who I am and what I can create. The container that
                    houses my work is a reflection of my work itself, so I wanted to make sure
                    this website was beautiful, useful, and functional.

            <h2>Designing Through Development</h2>
            <p>I began by designing the site in Figma, where I created layouts
                 for a few pages. However, as someone new to web development,
                  translating my design into code brought many challenges.
                   The website evolved as I started coding, with simplifications made
                    to accommodate my growing understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                     This iterative process taught me how design and development inform one another,
                      especially when you're learning and doing both simultaneously. Starting with zero knowledge
                       of web development, I worked one step at a time, researching and solving to create
                        a responsive and interactive website that alligns with my inital design vision.

            <h2>Looking Back</h2>
            <p> While I'm proud of the outcome, I can now see countless
                 opportunities for improvement. Since building this website,
                  I've learned more advanced techniques like React.js, CSS 
                  variables, and modern development practices, all of which would 
                  streamline and elevate the site today. These changes would simplify
                  the source code and allow for easier updating and additons. I plan
                  on some day revisiting this project to implement these improvements, but for now,
                  I'm happy with the site as it stands.
